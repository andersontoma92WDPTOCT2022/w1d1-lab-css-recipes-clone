        <br />This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen
        another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me
        several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one
        of your favorites as well!

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
        saucepan. <br />Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar
        and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let
        simmer.<br />
        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
        slightly.<br />
        Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
        over the crust. <br />Pour slowly so that it does not run off. Bake 15
        minutes in the preheated oven. <br />Reduce the temperature to 350
        degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
        apples are soft.
